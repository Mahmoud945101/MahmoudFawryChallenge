# Fawry Internship Challenge - Java OOP

## 👨‍💻 Author
**Mahmoud Fawzy**

## 📚 Overview
This repository contains my solution for the **Fawry Quantum Internship Challenge**.

The challenge simulates a simple e-commerce cart system using Java and Object-Oriented Programming concepts. It includes:

- Product types (e.g., Cheese, ScratchCard)
- Shipping rules
- Expiry validation
- Customer balance management
- Checkout and receipt
- Clean structure with reusable classes

## 🧠 Concepts Applied
- ✅ OOP principles (abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation)
- ✅ Interfaces and polymorphism
- ✅ Exception handling and validations
- ✅ Dynamic pricing and shipping logic

## 🧪 Test Cases Handled
- ✔️ Normal purchase (valid products + enough balance)
- ✔️ Empty cart
- ✔️ Expired product
- ✔️ Insufficient stock
- ✔️ Insufficient balance
- ✔️ Non-shippable product

## 🔧 How to Run
- Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ)
- Run the `FawryInternshipChallenge.java` inside `src/main/java/com/fawry/fawryinternshipchallenge/`
- Checkout result will be printed in the console

## 🚀 Notes
- The project is built using Maven
- The solution was tested and all edge cases were verified

Thanks for the opportunity 🙏
